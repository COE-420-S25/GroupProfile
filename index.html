        <h2>Kinan Khaskieh</h2>
        <p>I am studying Computer Science with a standing of Senior 1. During my studies at AUS my favorite topics to study are computer vision and cyber security.  To cool my head of studying I enjoy playing chess in my short breaks and game development during long breaks. I have a passion for redesigning retro games to add my own touch and modifications, or to get the game to work on my own device. </p>
